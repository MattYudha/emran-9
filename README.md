## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, please follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
-   npm (or Yarn/pnpm)
-   A Supabase account and project
-   A Google Cloud project with Gemini API enabled
-   An EmailJS account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd emran-9
2. Install Dependencies
Bash

npm install
# or yarn install
# or pnpm install
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

# Google Gemini API Key
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# EmailJS Configuration (for Contact Form and RFQ Notifications)
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID="YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID"
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID="YOUR_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID"
VITE_RFQ_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID="YOUR_EMAILJS_RFQ_TEMPLATE_ID" # Optional, if different template for RFQ
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY="YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY"
VITE_EMAILJS_TO_EMAIL="YOUR_COMPANY_RECEIVER_EMAIL" # Email address where contact forms and RFQs will be sent
Note: Ensure you replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and URLs.

4. Set Up Supabase Project
a. Initialize Supabase CLI
First, install the Supabase CLI if you haven't already:

Bash

npm install -g supabase
Then, link your local project to your Supabase project:

Bash

supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
b. Run Migrations
Apply the database schema migrations to your Supabase project. These migrations will create all necessary tables, RLS policies, and functions.

Bash

supabase db push
c. Deploy Edge Functions
Deploy the Supabase Edge Functions for send-email and rfq-notification:

Bash

# First, ensure your .env.local variables are accessible by the CLI
# For send-email function
supabase functions deploy send-email --no-verify-jwt --env-file .env.local

# For rfq-notification function (if you want to handle RFQ notifications via Supabase Function)
supabase functions deploy rfq-notification --no-verify-jwt --env-file .env.local
Important: Make sure SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set in your Supabase project's secrets for the send-email and rfq-notification functions to access the database with elevated privileges.

d. Configure RLS (Row Level Security)
RLS policies are defined in the migration files (supabase/migrations/*.sql) and are applied with supabase db push. Verify these policies are correctly applied in your Supabase dashboard to ensure data security.

5. Start the Development Server
Bash

npm run dev
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).

6. Build for Production
Bash

npm run build
# or yarn build
# or pnpm build
This will create a dist directory with the optimized production build.
